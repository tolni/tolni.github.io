	<h3>Prosthetic Limbs</h3>

	<div class="container-fluid infobox">
          	<p>Years back, a 3000-year-old mummy was unearthed by archaeologists. However, there was something very unique about this discovery. Buried with the mummy, archaeologists found a wooden, prosthetic toe... </p>
		<p>This unusual form of a prosthetic was equipped with straps to attach to the foot and leg, while the toe was even made to flex, which is quite extraordinary when you think about the time period in which it was constructed. Though this mummy wasn’t the first ancient artifact to be discovered sporting a prosthetic limb of sorts. In 1910, the Capua Leg was discovered north of Naples, dating back to 300 BC. This European prosthetic was sculpted from wood with an outer layer of bronze. The top portion of the prosthetic was hollowed out with padding at the bottom to accommodate the owner. Additionally, this ancient prosthetic was equipped with thin rods and straps that secured the limb in place.</p>
		<p>Varieties of prosthetic limbs have been known to date back to the BC eras, and it’s truly amazing to see the evolution of prosthetic limbs. Thanks to extraordinary advancements in technology, the development, and design of prosthetics have greatly evolved.</p>

		<p>In the 21st century we constantly improve our day to day tasks and functionalities by the use of technology. We are so used to our mobile smart phones as we walk down to the bus stop. But what about those who don't have the luxury to do that?</p>
		<p>A team at the University of Michigan have released details on the design and clinical tests of an open-source bionic leg which are now freely available online, so that researchers can hopefully create and test safe and useful new prosthetics.</p>
		<p>Bionic knees, ankles and legs under development worldwide to help patients walk are equipped with electric motors. Getting the most from such powered prosthetics requires safe and reliable control systems that can account for many different types of motion: for example, shifting from striding on level ground to walking up or down ramps or stairs.</p>

	<h3>Why is this so significant?</h3>
	
	<div class="container-fluid infobox">
		<p>Developing such control systems has proven difficult. “The challenge stems from the fact that these limbs support a person's body weight,” says Elliott Rouse, a biomedical engineer and director of the neurobionics lab at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. “If it makes a mistake, a person can fall and get seriously injured. That's a really high burden on a control system, in addition to trying to have it help people with activities in their daily life.”</p>
		<p>Part of the problem with designing these control systems is the fact that many research groups don't have access to prosthetic legs for testing purposes. As such, they have to either build their own, which is expensive and time-consuming, or rely on virtual testing, which may not adequately emulate real-life situations.</p>
		<p>To solve this problem, Rouse and his colleagues have developed the Open Source Leg. The scientists detailed their research findings online in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. Accompanying the artificial limb are free-to-copy step-by-step guides meant to assist researchers looking to assemble it or order parts for it. The Michigan group has also produced videos illustrating how to build and test the hardware, and has developed code for programming the prosthetic to walk using a preliminary control system.</p>

          The heart is a complex organ that pumps blood through the body with an intricate system of muscle layers, chambers, valves and nodes.
          The heart is considered as the body’s circulatory pump, located in the thoracic cavity. It is made up of four chambers, two upper chambers known as Atria and two lower, thicker walled chambers, known as Ventricles. 
          It has a strong muscular wall and is made up of a special type of muscle known as myocardium, which is only found in the heart. The septum divides the two sides of the heart and four one way valves control the blood flow. 
          These valves prevent the backward flow of blood, and are actual flaps that are located on each end of the two ventricles (lower chambers of the heart). They act as one-way inlets of blood on one side of a ventricle and one-way outlets of blood on the other side of a ventricle.

        Since the heart is technically the source of life, it unfortunately means that heart diseases are one of the leading causes of death. 
        Aortic stenosis, a condition that occurs when the heart’s aortic valve narrows and prevents the valve from opening fully, is one of the most common cardiovascular conditions in the elderly and affects about 2.7 million adults over the age of 75 in North America. 
        Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis is associated with high mortality rates, up to 50% at 1 year, and the prevalence will likely increase as the population ages.

        Thankfully, researchers from the University of Minnesota, with support from Medtronic, have developed a groundbreaking process for multi-material 3D printing of lifelike models of the heart’s aortic valve and the surrounding structures that mimic the exact look and feel of a real patient.
        These patient-specific organ models, which include 3D-printed soft sensor arrays integrated into the structure, are fabricated using specialized inks and a customized 3D printing process. Such models can be used in preparation for minimally invasive procedures to improve outcomes in thousands of patients worldwide.
        <br>
        The researchers 3D printed what is called the aortic root, the section of the aorta closest to and attached to the heart. The aortic root consists of the aortic valve and the openings for the coronary arteries. The aortic valve has three flaps, called leaflets, surrounded by a fibrous ring. The model also included part of the left ventricle muscle and the ascending aorta.
        The aortic root models are made by using CT scans of the patient to match the exact shape. They are then 3D printed using specialized silicone-based inks that mechanically match the feel of real heart tissue.

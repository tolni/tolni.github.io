            <h3>Predicting Protein Folding Using AI</h3>

            <div class="container-fluid infobox">
                <p>Proteins have a wide range of uses and applications, from breaking down industrial waste to helping cure diseases. 
                    This is all possible due to the trillions upon trillions of ways a protein can fold, which is determined by the amino acid sequence that makes up the protein. 
                    It has been estimated that there are around 10<sup>300</sup> ways a typical protein could fold, and finding a way to predict how a protein folds given its amino acid sequence is known as the 'protein folding problem'.

                    Deepmind's Alphafold uses AI and deep-learning architecture to computationally predict the 3d structure of a protein given its amino acid sequence in a matter of days. 
                    It treats the folded protein as a spatial graph, where nodes represent amino acid residues and edges connect nearby residues with each other, helping us understand how proteins physically interact with each other. 
                    Alphafold is built on an attention-based neural network that interprets and refines the structure of the graph using evalutionarily related sequences, multiple sequence alignment, and amino acid residue pairs; iterating this process to formulate accurate predictions.
                    Current experimental techniques like cryo-electron microscopy, on the other hand, can take years per protein and require expensive specialised equipment. 
                    Alphafold produces results on-par with these experimental techniques, having errors only as small as the width of an atom or two on average. 
                    Accuracy is mainly measured using the Global Distance Test (GDT), which gives scores between 0 and 100 (which can be thought of the "percentage of amino acid residues within a threshold distance from the correct position") where scores greater than 90 can informally be considered competitive with experimental results. Alphafold achieved a median score of 92.4 .

                    Alphafold's accurate predictions allow for leaps and bounds in understanding the human body, 
                    from figuring out the ways signals are transmitted across cell membranes to investigating how and why certain proteins malfunction, 
                    allowing us to improve our understanding of some diseases and find treatments faster. Alphafold isn't limited to only being used on 
                    pre-existing, known proteins, but can help with discovering the hundreds of millions of proteins currently without models.
